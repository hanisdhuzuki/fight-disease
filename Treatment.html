    <h3 id = "bigtitle">TREATMENTS</h3>
    <p>Some communicable diseases cause only mild symptoms that will disappear without any treatment.
       Others may cause some severe symptoms, or might potentially life threatening complications.
       The treatment for such diseases depends on whether they are bacterial, viral, or fungal.
       Theses are the three types of treatment that can be taken by the patient of such diseases:</p>

        <p id="treatmentContent"><strong>Bacterial Diseases</strong></p>
        <p id="treatmentContent2">
           A person who has a bacterial infection may require a course of antibiotics to help control
           the infection. These drugs work by killing off the bacteria or preventing them from replicating.
           When it comes to antibiotics, take your doctor's advice on whether you need them or not. If people
           overuse antibiotics or use them incorrectly, the bacteria might become resistant. This means that
           the antibiotic becomes less effective against that type of bacterium, as the bacterium has been
           able to improve its defenses.</p>

        <h4 class= "smalltitle">Antifungal</h4>

        <p id="treatmentContent"><strong>Fungal Diseases</strong></p>
        <p id="treatmentContent2">
           Antifungal drugs can work in two ways: by directly killing fungal cells or by preventing fungal cells from growing and thriving.
           The type of drug used and the way it’s administered can depend on the drug and the type and severity of the infection.
           A severe or chronic fungal infection may require over-the-counter or prescription antifungal medications.
           These are available in both oral as a topical treatment, or via IV.</p>

        <h4 class= "smalltitle">Antiviral</h4>
        <img id = "Antiviral2" src = "Antiviral.jpg" alt="Antiviral">
        <p id="treatmentContent"><strong>Viral Diseases</strong></p>
        <p id="treatmentContent2">
           Antivirals treat infections by preventing the virus from spreading throughout your body.
           In other words, they don't kill the virus, outright, which makes developing antivirals tricky.
           Vaccines are a highly effective method for preventing specific viral infections.
           When a person receives a vaccine, they are receiving a dead or inactive form of the virus.
           The immune system responds by producing antibodies capable of killing an active form of the virus in the future.
           If a person already has a virus, they may require antiviral medications to keep the virus under control.</p>
